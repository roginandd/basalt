# Changelog

## [0.12.7](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/releases/tag/basalt/0.12.7) (Unreleased)

### Added

- [67c28ba](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/67c28bab33cb3e8f82f25bf4d2ffaf7ba8bcc9ad) Add vim motions, operators and text objects to the note editor by @erikjuhani

> Normal mode in the experimental editor gains a full vim editing
> grammar. Motions run over the whole document -- `0 ^ $`, `w W b B e E`,
> `{ } %`, `gg G`, and `f F t T` with `;` and `,` -- and any of them takes
> a count (`3w`, `10G`).
>
> Operators compose with those motions: `d c y` plus a motion, `dd cc
> yy`, `x D C s`, and `p` / `P` through an unnamed register. Text objects
> (`ci"`, `da(`, `ciw` ...), `r` to replace a character, and `u` /
> `ctrl+r` undo round it out; visual-mode `d`/`c`/`y` reuse the same path.
>
> Keys stay rebindable in `vim.toml`; only count digits and the character
> after `f`/`t`/`r` or a text object take a built-in path.

- [8f58061](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/8f5806145a422c2e6d3c23e2bb6fe9bd55001f58) Render callout block quotes by @erikjuhani

> Render Obsidian and GitHub callouts (`> [!note]`) with a per-kind
> coloured bar and an icon + title header above the body, keeping the
> accent colour while editing.
>
> Support the full Obsidian type set (note, abstract, info, todo, tip,
> success, question, warning, failure, danger, bug, example, quote) and
> their aliases, plus custom titles and fold markers (`[!note]- Title`),
> which pulldown-cmark does not recognise. Type names are case-insensitive
> and unknown types fall back to note, as in Obsidian.
>
> Each type has a configurable symbol across the ascii, unicode and nerd
> font presets.

- [00430a8](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/00430a85d15c49a0b6d5ea81038608ab15abe57d) Add vim visual selection with clipboard yank by @erikjuhani

> Visual selection comes to the vim-mode note editor. `v` starts a
> charwise selection and `V` a linewise one, motions extend it, `y` yanks
> the selection to the system clipboard and `esc` cancels. A brief flash
> marks the yanked range, and the highlight is painted per character and
> clipped to the editor viewport.
>
> Clipboard writes use the platform utility (pbcopy, wl-copy, xclip, xsel
> or clip) with an OSC 52 fallback for SSH and tmux, so no new dependency
> is added.

- [1b66afd](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/1b66afdca6c036072981332877fa04b9a6610035) Pan viewport horizontally to follow the cursor in edit mode by @erikjuhani

> Long source lines are shown raw (unwrapped) while editing, so the cursor
> could move past the right edge and disappear. Track a horizontal scroll
> offset and pan the document so the cursor stays visible, mirroring the
> existing vertical follow logic.
>
> When the document pans, full-width fills must extend with it or they stop
> short of the right edge. Thread the scroll offset through the render path
> so code-block backgrounds, heading underlines, and the title rule span
> `width + offset`, covering every visible block, not just the one being
> edited.

- [51d9f92](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/51d9f92a834f1e30c84edaee380d6f7e9d168052) Add markdown table rendering to the note editor

> Tables were parsed away as paragraphs and never drawn. The note editor
> now renders GFM tables as bordered boxes in reading view. Columns size
> to their content and, when the table is too wide to fit, share the spare
> width in proportion to each column's demand the way browsers lay out
> tables, so a long column takes the most slack without starving the
> others, and cell text wraps to fit.
>
> While editing, a table renders as the same box but reveals the row under
> the cursor as raw markdown so its pipes stay editable, and every row
> including the delimiter is reachable. The box is only drawn while the
> buffer still parses as a table, so the moment the syntax breaks the block
> falls back to raw line by line editing and a half broken table never
> hides itself.
>
> A thematic break is now kept as a plain paragraph instead of being
> dropped, because a table whose pipes are deleted degrades into a bare
> dash row that would otherwise vanish from the document.

### Breaking

- [1863417](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/1863417adfd88ba2f82b7879ea456054ef01d38f) Relicense: GPL-3.0 for app, Apache-2.0 for libraries; add CLA by @erikjuhani

> Move off MIT to a split model that protects against proprietary forks
> while keeping the libraries reusable.
>
> - basalt-tui: MIT -> GPL-3.0-or-later (copyleft and patent grant)
> - basalt-core and basalt-widgets: MIT -> Apache-2.0 (permissive,
>   reusable, with a patent grant)
>
> Add a lightweight Contributor License Agreement so future GPL
> contributions can still be relicensed, including under a commercial
> license, without chasing past contributors for sign-off. Contributors
> keep their copyright and agree by opening a pull request.
>
> Document the split in the README and CONTRIBUTING, and add a pull
> request template that acknowledges the CLA.
>
> Already-published versions remain MIT for anyone who has them; the new
> terms take effect with this release (0.12.7).

## [0.12.6](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/releases/tag/basalt/0.12.6) (Jun, 21 2026)

### Added

- [afcad08](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/afcad08e3f2e8bde5424c054288c28a08382b6b5) Allow named keys in chord sequences (e.g. <space>f) by @erikjuhani

> Treat <...> as a grouping delimiter in binding strings so a named or
> modified key acts as a single keystroke inside a sequence, enabling
> Helix-style leader bindings like <space>f and <space><space>.
>
> The group contents are parsed exactly like a standalone key, and a group
> must resolve to one keystroke (multi-key, unterminated, and empty groups
> error). < and > are reserved for the syntax; bind the literals via <lt>
> and <gt>.
>
> Closes #516

- [69308e5](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/69308e5452e94b9a3f532b071f7012fd807db55e) Add debug log overlay widget by @erikjuhani

> A toggleable in-TUI debug log overlay (‹g<›) shows tracing output across
> all levels (trace, debug, info, warn, error) on top of the application
> without interfering with normal use. A bounded ring buffer captures events
> through a tracing layer; the overlay supports scrolling, clearing and a
> minimum-level filter. It can also be opened on startup with `--debug` and
> filtered with `--log-level`. Relevant logging was added across the app.

- [3b1b400](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/3b1b400f961eb1de8af0e5bb8a6fa1b9c431b59a) Watch vault filesystem for changes in Explorer by @realkotob

> The Explorer now watches the vault root recursively and refreshes when
> markdown files or directories change on disk, so external moves,
> additions and deletions are reflected without a user-initiated refresh.
> The watcher is rebuilt when the active vault changes and avoids stealing
> focus from the editor.

### Changed

- [0ae7ea4](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/0ae7ea48487af46f52df7de01cb2970dfa917b4e) Render edit mode line by line (#486)

> Editing used to flip the whole block to raw on entry, and rendering it
> from the AST during edits drifted from the source, so nested lists and
> structural edits were unreliable.
>
> Render the active block with a line decorator that maps 1:1 to source
> place. This keeps indentation, blank lines and code blocks faithful to
> the source and makes editing predictable.
>
> Read mode and non-active blocks keep the AST renderer; unifying the two
> is tracked in #533.

### Fixed

- [f40bc77](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/f40bc77e49fc7e27aca04cd0936d8f4cd746ad17) Preserve source blank lines in Edit mode by @erikjuhani

> In Edit mode the visual rendering now mirrors the source's blank-line
> structure. Empty lines between loose list items render as empty rows,
> and block spacing matches the source byte gap instead of a fixed "one
> empty line per block". Adjacent blocks with no source empty lines now
> render with no visual gap, so deleting at a block's start merges into
> the previous block without a misleading empty row in between.

## [0.12.5](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/releases/tag/basalt/0.12.5) (May, 16 2026)

### Added

- [d8eb23e](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/d8eb23e62a260d01ff31fc3690b7fe221504e6c5) Add experimental vault path override via BASALT_EXP_VAULT_PATH by @erikjuhani

> Allows opening an arbitrary directory as a vault by setting the env var,
> skipping the splash screen and going straight to the explorer.

- [9bb26d8](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/9bb26d8e618ed09b2f3d1ebab5709a08d6b82acf) Add scrollbar to vault selector by @erikjuhani

> The scrollbar is now visible in both splash screen and the vault
> selector modal. It's not optimal, but I realized that vault selection
> needs a rewrite, thus I didn't bother to do this properly for example
> the scrollbar is always shown if we have more than 4 items regardless if
> we have space to show all items and not needing a scrollbar.

- [8e248e7](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/8e248e736afd27a36ba941479f68c8fa858bda9f) Add basalt CLI layer

> Initial CLI layer with --version and --help flags. The version output is
> in a "standard" format similar to cargo version output `0.12.5 (abc123def 2026-05-15)`.
>
> The values are populated by a build phase (compile time) using env vars.

### Changed

- [022d988](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/022d988f1709a10d4ef45449e4a138390b585339) Add indentation to floating rename input by @erikjuhani

> The rename input in explorer pane was fixed to left border of explorer
> pane, and forced vision to jump in deeply nested fields. This commit
> adds indentation to the floating rename input which is calculated by the
> depth of the explorer item. Additionally added depth field to items.

- [f53a500](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/f53a5009a6f8e55474320bf20548bab5a635df21) Create new notes and folders under the selected folder by @erikjuhani

> CreateUntitledNote and CreateUntitledFolder now resolve a target
> directory from the explorer's current item (the directory itself, a
> file's parent, or the vault root as fallback) instead of always creating
> at the vault root. After creation the explorer expands that directory so
> the new item is visible.
>
> Add an explorer Open message that always expands a directory rather than
> toggling, backed by a new ExplorerState::open. The existing toggle
> behavior moves to a Select message, and the ExplorerOpen command and
> shell-return path now map to Select. toggle_item_in_tree takes an
> always_open flag to support both.

- [44e673e](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/44e673ecc5ef1ca09d21e51668c67c92bf3255eb) Bump basalt-core to 0.9.0 and update CHANGELOG by @erikjuhani

> Bump basalt-core to `0.9.0` version in basalt`

### Fixed

- [ca05c25](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/ca05c25e359cc061d855cb1607979537af6acc02) Merge with previous block when backspacing at block start by @erikjuhani

> Backspace at the start of a block's text buffer used to do
> nothing. It now merges the current block into the previous one,
> preserving in-progress edits. The merge is a no-op when previous
> and current block indices coincide, so backspace at the start of
> the first block does not collapse the only AST node.
>
> Supporting changes:
>
> - Add `previous_block_idx`, rename `current_block` to
>   `current_block_idx`. Both return owned `usize`.
> - Add `TextBuffer::insert_at_start`, which prepends bytes and
>   moves both the live and original source range starts so a
>   later commit overwrites the joined region.
> - Walk children recursively in `shift_nodes` via a new
>   `ast::Node::children_as_mut`. Without this the cursor lands on
>   a stale child range after editing a paragraph above a list.
> - `commit_text_buffer` re-parses on `buffer.modified` rather
>   than on content change, since the merge mutates `ast_nodes` in
>   place and a buffer that round-trips needs a re-parse.
> - In `update_layout`'s deferred init, pick the editing block by
>   cursor source offset, not by a stale `virtual_row` lookup.
> - Rename `insertion_offset` to `source_pos`.

- [f06575f](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/f06575f97043cfaba999d2f80199dbd95837f2e5) Render trailing content after a heading in edit mode by @erikjuhani

> A heading's source range can include a paragraph that follows it
> when the user types a newline mid-edit. The raw renderer treated
> the whole range as one heading line, so the new content was
> invisible until exit. Split on the first newline in raw mode and
> render the rest with `render_raw`.
>
> Also drop the synthetic empty trailer in raw mode so paragraphs
> don't gain a stray blank row when entering edit mode.

- [78c7299](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/78c7299576af8b4459d5c3ac390e489827af039e) Account for meta header rows when scrolling the editor by @erikjuhani

> `ensure_cursor_visible` was comparing `cursor.virtual_row`
> against `viewport.top()` and a `viewport.bottom()` shrunk by
> `meta_len`. The meta rows live above the content, so the cursor's
> screen row is `virtual_row + meta_len`. The old comparison
> scrolled the editor up too early when the meta header was
> visible, hiding the first content rows.
>
> Add `meta_len` to the cursor's screen position before comparing
> against the viewport bounds, thread it through `CursorWidget` so
> it draws at the same offset, and add `Viewport::scroll_up` so
> vertical motion that consumes more rows than the viewport
> contains scrolls the document.

- [db69b04](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/db69b04d93ec54da925cb2453b637591246a54e8) Preserve nested file depth in explorer refresh by @erikjuhani

> `map_to_item` handled `VaultEntry::File` via `Item::from`, which
> hardcodes `depth: 0`. Files still rendered correctly, but the rename
> input modal positions from `Item::depth()`, placing it flush-left for
> nested files.

- [6da6548](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/6da6548325725d96a712665fe81273526da0c4df) Preserve note scroll position when toggling explorer folders by @erikjuhani

> Toggling a folder open or closed re-emitted SelectNote for the currently
> selected note, which rebuilt the note editor and reset its viewport
> scroll position.
>
> Explorer state `open()` and `select()` now report (bool) whether a note
> was actually selected, and the explorer only emits SelectNote in that
> case, which then effectively retains the scroll position of the
> viewport.

- [79082f3](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/79082f317efc499febb6bc7c892cd7f6c84b2887) Use config symbols for status bar component badge by @erikjuhani

> Pass the configured symbol preset into StatusBar so the active component
> badge falls back to ASCII-safe glyphs when the Ascii preset is selected.

## [0.12.4](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/releases/tag/basalt/0.12.4) (Apr, 09 2026)

### Added

- [c3f2b41](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/c3f2b412c5e6eb09992287ead881311fc25b4b08) Add `Symbols` config types with presets by @erikjuhani

> Introduces symbols and symbol presets  as the foundation for
> configurable UI symbols. Each preset provides a complete set of defaults
> for all visual glyphs used across the interface. Users pick a preset in
> `[symbols]` and optionally override individual fields on top of it.
>
> Also added derives `PartialEq` and `serde::Deserialize` on `FontStyle`
> so heading and title font styles can be configured from toml.
>
> Related to #424

- [7d53d0a](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/7d53d0abf84306b3207ca2115a57c00c5cc309ff) Surface config errors as warning toasts by @erikjuhani

> Previously config parsing errors were silently swallowed. Now we return
> warnings alongside the config so they can be shown to the user. Invalid
> config files produce an `InvalidConfig` error with the TOML parser's
> message. The `UserConfigNotFound` case is still silently ignored since
> most users won't have a config file.
>
> Additionally toasts now support word-wrapped multi-line messages via
> `textwrap` and compute their height dynamically instead of using a fixed
> constant. This lets longer error messages display fully rather than
> getting truncated. Toast stacking in `render_toasts` accounts for
> variable heights.

> Extend Preset with an Auto variant that detects terminal capabilities at
> startup by inspecting TERM, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG environment

## [0.12.3](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/releases/tag/basalt/0.12.3) (Mar, 10 2026)

### Added

- [eb66637](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/eb66637bd7498abe7dfae0d97069440eb9a35d38) Add support for sequential keys by @erikjuhani

> This change adds support for a sequence (or chord) of keys like 'gg' or
> 'bn' or 'gth'.
>
> The keys maps are separated into Single keys (which can contain
> modifiers) or a 'sequence' of keys called Chord.
>
> Additionally added support for uppercased chars in key bindings, which
> means that users can now use shift + char to run commands.
>
> Organized and structured the key code parsing, so it's more readable and
> the 'special' cases are clearly represented.

>   to drive accumulation and prefix/exact matching
> - Add `ConfigSection::sequence_to_message` and `is_sequence_prefix`
> - Remove old `key_to_message` / `handle_active_component_event`, editing
>   bypass is now inlined in `handle_key_event`
> - `handle_editing_event` in input and note_editor now take `KeyEvent` by

> When opening an empty file and entering edit mode, no text or cursor was
> visible until pressing ESC. This was caused by three issues:
>
> - No AST nodes existed for empty files, so layout produced no virtual

> - `render_raw` produced no content lines for empty content, leaving the
>   cursor with no valid position
>
> Fix by creating a placeholder paragraph node when entering insert mode
> on an empty document, allowing cursor rendering in edit mode, and
> producing a content line in `render_raw` for the empty content case.

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/releases/tag/basalt/0.11.0) (Nov, 30 2025)

Basalt author and maintainer here! Wanted to write a few words before the _regular_ changelog.

Phew, this took longer than expected, but here we are. The editor feature does not offer feature parity with the tui-textarea that was being used previously, however, it can properly wrap the text while writing, which frankly, I find quite pleasing.

If you encounter any bugs or additional strangeness please open an issue! The editor was made by me and most likely contains errors. Use with caution! :)

I'm taking a small break from basalt for the advent of code puzzles! So expect slower development during December.

This release fixes the following issues: [#105](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/issues/105), [#104](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/issues/104), [#95](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/issues/95)

### Added

- [ba8f3a0](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/ba8f3a0b260f935e88346a0f451572bdeac8ffe8) Introduce virtual document structure with rendering by @erikjuhani

> I decided to implement a virtual document, which is essentially the
> virtually rendered version of the markdown document. This virtual
> document is a collection of virtual blocks, virtual lines and virtual
> spans.
>
> Virtual lines and spans are turned into Ratatui variants to render them
> in terminal.
>
> Virtual spans are separated into two concepts, synthetic and content.
>
> - Synthetic spans are elements that are not calculated as part of the
>   markdown source.
> - Content spans on the other hand are elements that are calculated as
>   part of the markdown source.
>
> This separation enables more fluid use cases and easier management
> codewise for more rendered content, like text wrapping symbols,
> additional emphasize lines or spans, etc.
>
> Rendering is a collection of functions that are turned into virtual
> blocks. These virtual blocks map directly into top level markdown nodes.
>
> All rendered functions wrap the text with the given max width. The text
> wrapping is a generalized wrapping function that can be now run for "any"
> markdown node that is defined in the ast module.

- [943256b](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/943256b8710cdd2081836c877623a3db8be21b70) Add Cursor module by @erikjuhani

> Cursor module is responsible for keeping up with the cursor state.
> Cursor can be switched between two modes, read and edit.
>
> Each mode behaves a bit differently, read only considers the virtual
> elements, and edit mode considers the source content.
>
> For now only the read mode variant is properly implemented.
>
> The rendering is handled with a separate stateful CursorWidget component
> that takes the cursor state as an input and draws the cursor
> accordingly.
>
> In read mode the cursor is drawn as a full-width line cursor.

> Also add empty_line() helper function to TextSegment struct. This
> creates a new empty line with "\n" as the content.
>
> This empty line can then be split in the render functions, but still
> keep the content inside a single markdown node (e.g. paragraph).

- [5222b7e](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/5222b7e316227076d287f897500cc479386db53e) Add text wrapping helper utility

> The text wrapper module exposes `wrap_preserve_trailing`, which, as name
> implies, keeps the trailing whitespace.
>
> I'm using the `textwrap::WordSeparator` to find and iterate over the
> words in the text, and then determine if the word fits in the current
> line by using the passed max width variable. The `textwrap` crate itself
> did not ship with a premade wrapping utility that would have preserved

### Changed

- [ee4976f](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/ee4976f7734fc2ef67145195be3fa0f7f8fd3ecf) Replace old editor with new implementation by @erikjuhani

> The old note editor variant was hard to maintain and was lacking proper
> structure. Adding new ast nodes or elements was a cumbersome process.
>
> The new variant uses logical structures like virtual document and
> separate rendering functions to achieve a more cohesive end result.
>
> The editor now requires to have a viewport in order to render anything
> properly. This is a requirement for example to decide the correct
> wrapping width for text elements.
>
> This change also introduces fix for scrolling. Now scrolling works
> properly and cursor is always visible in the viewport. This fixes the
> issue #104.
>
> The rendering is simplified drastically due to the use of more logical
> structures.

- [d00f9d4](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/commit/d00f9d41fa05274644a8250d2bd1684193da78af) Implement custom text editor

> This custom implementation replaces tui-textarea with proper text
> wrapping and better WYSIWYG experience. Also the custom implementation
> allows for more granular control over how elements are, rendered and
> positioned.
>
> I tried to mimic the previous functionality in a way so as little is
> lost as possible feature wise, obviously, since this is made from
> scratch the feature parity is far off still.
>
> Additionally there is some known issues, like cursor positioning is
> incorrect with unicode symbols in source content. This can be observed
> by wrong end position when moving the cursor to the right most end. The
> cursor appears as if it is stuck, but that is due to wrong count
> somewhere, which should be fixed, but in a different commit.
>
> For now the implementation is very limited and implements only a
> restricted set of features: Editing markdown nodes, saving changes to
> file, moving by words and scrolling by half pages.
>
> This commit has quite many changes, and, unfortunately the nature of how
> this refactor was introduced, was difficult to separate the commits
> atomically and cleanly to smaller pieces.
>
> But the most notable ones are:
>
> - Cursor changes, which include the cursor movement by columns and words
>   and proper cursor positioning from the source offset location.
>
> - Editor state changes to allow insertion, deletion and saving of files,
>   and source range shifting, which is related to the editor
>   functionality, which essentially shifts the end of the source range,
>   if the source ranges are not shifted properly and if the text buffer
>   exceeds the range start of next node the text buffer would be
>   replicated and rendered in-place of the next node.
>
> - Render changes, which introduce a new consolidated text wrapping and
>   handling for newline characters in both visual and raw rendering
>   modes. The new consolidated text wrapping uses the new whitespace
>   preserving text wrap function. Additionally source offset for rendered
>   virtual lines were fixed. Also added unicode-width dependency for
>   accurate unicode character width calculations in render.
